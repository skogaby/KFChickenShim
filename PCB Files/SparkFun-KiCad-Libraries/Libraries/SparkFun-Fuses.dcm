$CMP PPTC_HALF-AMP
D Resettable Fuse PPTC Resettable Fuse. Really a sort of resistor with a <b>p</b>olymeric <b>p</b>ositive <b>t</b>emperature <b>c</b>oefficient whose resistance increases dramatically with an increase in temperature. When heated by the power passing through the resistance rises causing the current to be limited, protecting the circuit. This is achieved by the transition of the polymer from a crystalline to an amorphous state where the conductive carbon separates breaking the conductive pathways found in the cool crystalline structure. When a PPTC cools back down it resumes conducting letting the circuit turn back on.
