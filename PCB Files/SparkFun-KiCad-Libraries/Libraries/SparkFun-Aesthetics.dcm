$CMP FIDUCIALTAB
D Fiducial Panel Tab This is half of a tab, with fiducial reference mark, used to connect individual boards in a panel of PCBs. Two of these half tabs, rotated in opposite directions, can be connected together to form a full tab, with two fiducial markings. Place along the edge of a panel of PCBs, this will allow for panels with boards not connected by v-scores, which allows for easier depanelization where there are overhanging components. It can also be used for designs too small to accomodate fiducial marks on individual boards.
