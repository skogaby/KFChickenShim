$CMP VENUS638FLPX-L
D Venus638FLPX-L GPS Receiver Venus638FLPx is a high performance, low cost, single chip GPS receiver targeting mobile consumer and cellular handset applications. It offers very low power consumption, high sensitivity, and best in class signal acquisition and time-to-first-fix performance.Venus638FLPx contains all the necessary components of a complete GPS receiver, includes 1.2dB cascaded system NF RF front-end, GPS baseband signal processor, 0.5ppm TCXO, 32.768kHz RTC crystal, RTC LDO regulator, and passive components. It requires very low external component count and takes up only 100mm2 PCB footprint.Dedicated massive-correlator signal parameter search engine within the baseband enables rapid search of all the available satellites and acquisition of very weak signal. An advanced track engine allows weak signal tracking and positioning in harsh environments such as urban canyons and under deep foliage. The self-contained architecture keeps GPS processing off the host and allows integration into applications with very little resource. <h4>SparkFun Products</h4><ul><li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10919">GPS Module - Venus638FLPx-L 20Hz (14 Channel)</a> (GPS-10919)</li></ul>
