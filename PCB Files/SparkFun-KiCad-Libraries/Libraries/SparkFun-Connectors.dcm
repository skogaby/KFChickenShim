$CMP 6_PIN_SERIAL_CABLEPTH
D 6-pin header connection for use with the "FTDI BASIC" pinout - CABLE SIDE.  Also known as "Arduino Serial Program Header".  This is used on a design to provide a 6-pin connection point for serial communication usually from a USB cable (D+/D-) to these headers (RX/TX). It also has the remaining pins necessary for programming in the Arduino evironment (DTR, GND, and sometimes VCC). <b>Note, this device has "CABLE" in the name.</b>  It is intended to be used on a design that usually lives on the end of your USB cable and prvides the converter chip (FTDI232 or FTDI231x) to commnicate serial RX/TX.  <b>The "sister" device, named "TARGET"</b> is inteneded to be used on a design that contains a target micro-controller that you wish to program. <b>You can populate with some of these:</b><ul><li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/115"> Female Headers</a> (PRT-00115)</li></ul> For reference (or to suit your programming needs) check out these designs:<ul><li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9716"> SparkFun FTDI Basic Breakout - 5V</a> (DEV-09716)</li><li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9873"> SparkFun FTDI Basic Breakout - 3.3V</a> (DEV-09873)</li><li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12935"> SparkFun FTDI SmartBasic</a> (DEV-12935)</li><li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13746"> SparkFun Beefy 3 - FTDI Basic Breakout</a> (DEV-13746)</li></ul>

This slight alteration caused the pins (the squares in the middle) to touch the edges of the holes.  Because they are alternating, it causes a "brace" to hold the component in place.  0.005 has proven to be the perfect amount of "off-center" position when using our standard breakaway headers. Although looks a little odd when you look at the bare footprint, once you have a header in there, the alteration is very hard to notice.

You may notice that each hole has been shifted either up or down by 0.005 of an inch from it's more standard position (which is a perfectly straight line).  This slight alteration caused the pins (the squares in the middle) to touch the edges of the holes.  Because they are alternating, it causes a "brace" to hold the component in place.  0.005 has proven to be the perfect amount of "off-center" position when using our standard breakaway headers. Although looks a little odd when you look at the bare footprint, once you have a header in there, the alteration is very hard to notice.  Also,if you push a header all the way into place, it is covered up entirely on the bottom side.

You may notice that each hole has been shifted either up or down by 0.005 of an inch from it's more standard position (which is a perfectly straight line).  This slight alteration caused the pins (the squares in the middle) to touch the edges of the holes.  Because they are alternating, it causes a "brace" to hold the component in place.  0.005 has proven to be the perfect amount of "off-center" position when using our standard breakaway headers. Although looks a little odd when you look at the bare footprint, once you have a header in there, the alteration is very hard to notice.  Also,if you push a header all the way into place, it is covered up entirely on the bottom side.

You may notice that each hole has been shifted either up or down by 0.005 of an inch from it's more standard position (which is a perfectly straight line).  This slight alteration caused the pins (the squares in the middle) to touch the edges of the holes.  Because they are alternating, it causes a "brace" to hold the component in place.  0.005 has proven to be the perfect amount of "off-center" position when using our standard breakaway headers. Although looks a little odd when you look at the bare footprint, once you have a header in there, the alteration is very hard to notice.  Also,if you push a header all the way into place, it is covered up entirely on the bottom side.
