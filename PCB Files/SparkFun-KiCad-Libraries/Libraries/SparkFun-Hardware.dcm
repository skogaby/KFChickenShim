D Actobotics Reference Packages This device contains a variety of refrence packages that can be used to plan out a design using actobotics hardware. Note, none of these packages have electrical conections (pins or pads), they are intended to be used for referencing drill spacing on Actobotics hardware.  It can take a lot of precise planning, measuring and calculating to mate a PCB design with the drill spacing of your projects hardware.   If you drop these packages into your eagle design, you can more easily know exactly where your drill hits should be.  Note, you could simply add these packages directly to your board file (without ever adding the "device" to your schematic). We created this device simple to make this collection of packages organized and more accessible   The "CHANNEL" packages simply have the outline of the Actobotics part, with some dotted lines to show the 1" and 0.5" grid points. If you set your grid to 0.75", then you can easlity place these various channels down to plan out your project. The "SINGLE_DRILL_REF" package contains the actual drill hit positions. It also contains the diameter for each drill hit. Once you have your channels layed out, then you can drop some of these packages on top to see the drill hit spacing. Note, all of these packages are drawn on the "tDocu" layer (51), so make sure that is turned on when viewing your design.
